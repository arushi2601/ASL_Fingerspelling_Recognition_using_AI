# ASL_Fingerspelling_Recognition_using_AI
Implemented using Kaggle's American Sign Language Fingerspelling Recognition competition 

Developed a model based on Kaggle's dataset for the ASL Fingerspelling Recognition competition. The purpose of this model is to detect and translate the American Sign Language(ASL) fingerspelling into text using a large dataset including more than three million fingerspelled characters produced by over 100 Deaf signers captured via the selfie camera of a smartphone with a variety of backgrounds and lighting conditions.
